/**
 * Leetcode 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array
 * Given an integer array nums of length n where all the integers of nums are in the range [1, n] and each integer appears once or twice, return an array of all the integers that appears twice.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses only constant extra space.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: nums = [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
 * Output: [2,3]
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1,1,2]
 * Output: [1]
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: nums = [1]
 * Output: []
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * n == nums.length
 * 1 <= n <= 105
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= n
 * Each element in nums appears once or twice.
